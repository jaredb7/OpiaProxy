This project was inspired by translink-opiaproxy (https://github.com/wislon/translink-opiaproxy), who has done a awesome job of making the 
Translink OPIA API easy to use.

I almost exclusively use the CakePHP framework when programming in PHP, so it made sense to make a plugin for it.

Most of the API models we're code-genned using the Swagger CodeGen project as a starting point and then modified to suite.
The proxy component is a 'grown up' version that was used in another project I contributed to (Survive Z Day), it can be extracted and used elsewhere easily with little modification.

Hopefully this project speeds and helps projects for those developing on the Translink OPIA API :).
